# Development 
The `pylammpsmpi` package was developed to prototype improvements for the LAMMPS python library interface. In particular,
it is designed to simplify the development of `mpi4py` parallel LAMMPS workflows. The primary goal of these developments
is to demonstrate the viability of these new concepts and encourage the integration in the official LAMMPS distribution. 

Any feedback and contributions are welcome.
